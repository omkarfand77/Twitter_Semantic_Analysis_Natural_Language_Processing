# **Twitter_Semantic_Analysis_Natural_Language_Processing**

The Data Contains following Coloumns:
Tweet: The text of the tweet
Class: The respective class to which the tweet belongs. There are 4 classes -:

1. Regular
2. Sarcasm
3. Figurative (both irony and sarcasm)
4. Irony
*Here dependent is Class of tweet and Independent is Tweet*

*Business Objective:*

1. Need to get sentiment analysis of tweets gauge its impact and type Architecture level analysis.
2. Data transformation/Text processing using R/Python
3. Need to get sentiments Analysis and Emotion mining with some charts like histogram, Density plot, Barplot, pie-plot etc.
4. Deployment through Flask/ Streamlit

## Preprocessing

1. Removing URL from text data
2. Removing Special Characters
3. Converting text data into lower case
4. Removing stopwords
5. tokenization
6. Lemmatization

## **Exloratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

By applying Bag of Words, TF-IDF and unigram, Bigram, Trigram Extracted max 200 feature showed graphical representation with Wordcloud, histogram and barplot.
**Feature Engineering and Feature Selection**
The Word2vec transformation of tweet performed with genism model to In Feature
